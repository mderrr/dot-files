1.2.0\r\n\r\nWe have finally released a new version of Haskell Language Server!\r\nThanks for all contributors, many bugs has been fixed, and many features has landed.\r\nHere are the summary of changes:\r\n\r\n- Basic support for GHC 9.0.1 is added.  \r\n  It does not support all plugins yet, but core GHCIDE features will work. For the detailed information that which plugins work, please refer [this list](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/297#issuecomment-855522891).\r\n- Support for GHC 8.10.5 is added.  \r\n  Note that macOS version is unfortunately not included in this release because of [a GHC issue with `network` package](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19968).\r\n- HLS wrapper and GHCIDE session loader uses the same logic with implicit-hie.  \r\n  This fixes [a build issue](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1782) of a stack project with implicit `hie.yaml` .\r\n- Wingman plugin has added numerous features and fixed many bugs:\r\n  - It now supports tactic metaprogramming!  \r\n    For list of commands, see [this document](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference).  \r\n    ![https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/118190278-bdf24f80-b3f7-11eb-8838-b08a2582d7f1.gif)\r\n  - \"Refine hole\" and \"Split all function arguments\" code actions are publicly opened.\r\n  - \"Empty case split\" code lens is added.\r\n  - The name generator is fixed [to avoid dangerous summon rituals](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/1760).\r\n  - Many bugs related to type families and GADTs are fixed.\r\n- We support [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), an upcoming way to manage dependencies in nix.\r\n- Every plugin (other than example plugins) now lives in its own package.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests merged for 1.2.0\r\n\r\n- Cleanup stack build output
